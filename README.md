# Just One Of Those Days
A rip off of the Shit Happens board game, loved it so much I wanted to try code my own version

# Basic Spec
100 cards with unpleasant experiences on them
Players rank each card with value from 1 to 100
1 is not very unpleasant, 100 is the most unpleasant thing
Cards assigned value which is avg. of ranks given by users (to 1 dec. place)
Players start with one card shown face up on "table", with an index
Players take turns drawing card.
Drawer does not reveal card, only reveals unpleasant event on card.
The player to drawer's right has to guess where in their face-up card ranges this new card lies. (e.g. if one card on table "higher or lower", or between two cards if more than one on table)
If they correctly guess where it lies, they place it on the table face up in front of them
If they don't, card goes to the bottom of the deck
The first player to 10 face up cards on the table wins!
