# Just One Of Those Days

# Basic Spec
100 cards with unpleasant experiences on them. 
Players rank each card with value from 1 to 100. 
1 is not very unpleasant, 100 is the most unpleasant thing possible. 
Cards assigned value which is avg. of ranks given by users (to 1 dec. place). 
Players start with one card shown face up on "table", with an index. 
Players take turns drawing card. 
Drawer does not reveal card, only reveals unpleasant event on card.
The player to drawer's right has to guess where in their face-up card ranges this new card lies. (e.g. if one card on table "higher or lower", or between two cards if more than one on table)
If they correctly guess where it lies, they place it on the table face up in front of them. 
If they don't, the next player on their right has a turn at guessing. 
This repeats until every player has had a guess or until someone guesses it correctly. 
If no one guesses correctly then the card is discarded and a new turn begins. 
The first player to 10 face up cards on the table wins!
