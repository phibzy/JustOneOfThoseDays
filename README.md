# Just One Of Those Days
A coded version of Stuff/S*** Happens by Goliath Games. I am in no way affiliated with them, this is purely a hobby project.

# Basic Spec
100 cards with unpleasant experiences on them. 
Each card has a misery index value on it between 0 and 100.
1 is not very unpleasant, 100 is the most unpleasant thing possible. 
Players start with three cards shown face up on "table".
Players take turns drawing a card. 
Card's misery index value is hidden, only the unpleasant event on the card is revealed.
The player has to guess where in their face-up card ranges this new card lies. (e.g. where does it fit within the values of their own cards).
If they correctly guess where it lies, they place it on the table face up in front of them. 
If they don't, the next player on their right has a turn at guessing. 
This repeats until every player has had a guess or until someone guesses it correctly. 
If no one guesses correctly then the card is discarded and a new turn begins. 
The first player to 10 face up cards on the table wins.
Alternatively, if there are no more cards in the deck then the player with the most cards at that point wins.
In the case of a tie, the player who first achieved the highest amount of cards will be the winner.
